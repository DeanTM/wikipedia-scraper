# Purpose
This is a personal project. The idea of this project has been nagging at me for ages, so I started tinkering with it.
I appreciate wikipedia articles, so I decided to write a script to:
* help to find the articles I enjoy
* make finding and reading articles more accessible

In doing so, I hope to:
* practice skills, particularly in nlp and web crawling
* learn features of articles I enjoy
* gain a more intuitive understanding of how nlp techniques and recommender systems work
* discover new articles
* create a tool I can tinker with when I wish to experiment with various applied machine learning techniques

# Requirements
For now, python3 with:
* nltk (with stopwords corpus)
* wikipedia (i.e. the friendly api)
* numpy

# Installation
For now, there is none. This is still just a script with printing to console. Inputs are typed too.
